Hello, friend. Welcome to my digital garden. **Here's an overview of what you can find here:**

## Open Source

The [code of this blog](https://github.com/laurosilvacom/laurosilva.com) is Open Source. However, it's highly customized and personally tailored. I encourage you to be creative and create your own blog.

## Privacy

In the spirit of a privacy-friendly site, I'm using [Simple Analytics](https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lauro). Which means that I don't use cookies or collect any personal data on you.

I've also made my **analytics open by default**, you can find them in the [Open Blog](/open-blog/) section.

## Newsletter

I've also started a newsletter. I am personally not a big fan of emails so I promise to only send emails when I have exciting things to share with you. [Sing up here](/newsletter).

## Writing

And of course my writing. **It will focus on JavaScript** for the browser and Node. I'll be publishing cheatsheet, similar to [React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet-es).

I'm super excited to start sharing my learnings. Keep an eye out for the next article! ðŸ™Œ

Until next time, friend!
