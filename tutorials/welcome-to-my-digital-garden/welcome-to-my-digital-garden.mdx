Hello, friend. Welcome to my digital garden.

Here's **what you can expect:**

## Writing

I'm treating my blog as a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). This means more incomplete tutorials at initial publish.

It will focus on **JavaScript** for the browser and **Node**. I'll also be publishing cheatsheet, similar to [React+TypeScript Cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet-es).

## Open Source

The [code of this blog](https://github.com/laurosilvacom/laurosilva.com) is Open Source. However, I encourage you to be creative and create your own blog. ðŸ˜…

## Privacy

In the spirit of a privacy-friendly site, I'm using [Simple Analytics](https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/lauro). Which means that I don't use cookies or collect any personal data on you.

I've also made my analytics open by default, you can find them in the [Open Blog](/open-blog/) section.

## Newsletter

I've also started a newsletter. I am personally not a big fan of emails so I promise to only send emails when I have exciting things to share with you. [Sing up here](/newsletter).

I'm super excited to start publishing. Keep an eye out for the next tutorial! ðŸ˜„

Until next time, friend!
