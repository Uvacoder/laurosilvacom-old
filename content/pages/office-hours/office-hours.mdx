I'm thankful for all the folks who helped me get to this point in my career! Mentorship has played a significant role in my journey. To continue paying it forward, I'm holding office hours.

If you're from an underrepresented community, my calendar is open for you.

### We can talk about:

- ✊🏾 Identifying as a POC
- 📚 Being self-taught
- 🚀 Breaking into the industry
- 🏠 Working as a remote employee
- 💻 Contributing to open source
- 👨🏽‍🏫 Teaching/being an instructor
- ⚛️ Learning JavaScript/React/Web development

### How does Office Hours work?

Just schedule a time slot of 45 minutes on my [calendar](https://calendly.com/laurosilvacom/meeting).
