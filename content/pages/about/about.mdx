My name is Lauro Silva, I'm a software engineer and instructor. I contribute to [open source](https://github.com/laurosilvacom) projects and [teach](https://egghead.io/instructors/lauro-silva) JavaScript for the browser and Node.

I'm also a collaborator at [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/lauro-silva), a community of badass web developers.
