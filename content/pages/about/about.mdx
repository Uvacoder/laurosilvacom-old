I'm a software engineer, and instructor. I learn and teach JavaScript, React and web development. I'm also a full-time collaborator at [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), a community of badass web developers. My hobbies include but are not limited to, writing, designing, and trail running. I live in Portland, Oregon.
