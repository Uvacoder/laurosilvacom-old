- What are webmentions?
  - A [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) is an open standard for a reaction to something on the web.
    - W3C standard - full recommendation in Jan 2017
    - [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
      - Group of hipsters with websites trying to take down THE MAN (aka the corporate web)
  - When you link to a website, you can send it a Webmention to notify it.
  - Somewhat of a "Ping" or "@"
- The new workflow
  - I write a pretty cool post on laurosilva.com
  - I post a link to the post on Twitter
  - Someone RT's, Likes or Comments on Twitter.
  - Social media activity shows up on my blog post.
  - I’m effectively just outsourcing my comments to Twitter now. 😅

- How to get started
  - [Chris Biscardi’s source plugin](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/building-gatsby-plugin-webmentions) to pull data from [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/)’s API
  - WebMention.io takes care of the nitty gritty of accepting & storing WebMentions.
  - [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) crawls social media activity into WebMentions. Send that data using a Webhook to laurosilva.com.
    - Bridgy looks at the post linked in my tweet, loads the link tag pointing it to webmention.io, and sends a WebMention to laurosilva.com
  - Pull the data into my Gatsby blog.
    - My site rebuilds pulling data from webmention.io
